iTec-App
========
i-Tec stands for Inventory, Travel, Events, Cooking and is a mobile phone application that makes it easier for people to create and access inventories, directions to places, calendar events, and cooking recipes to share. 

Inventory is the abstract version of several different types of inventory apps, one of which is called Shopping List. One shopping list is the Back-to-School one. 

In the Back-to-School App (currently for Windows Phone and called Test2), there is a main page, from which you can select to create your own shopping list, open an existing list, or choose items from a pre-existing list of back-to-school shopping items.

The back-to-school app is an extension of the inventory app, so therefore it has the same style, where there is a table of items, of which each cell can be clicked to reveal extra details of a specific item.
